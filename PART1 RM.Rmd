## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
URL= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/assessment_task3/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files/gene_expression.tsv"
NAME= "gene_expression.tsv"
download.file(URL,destfile=NAME)

head(read.delim("gene_expression.tsv"))
head(read.delim("gene_expression.tsv"))
str(read.delim("gene_expression.tsv"))

cds = read.delim("gene_expression.tsv")

head(cds)
row.names(cds)
row.names(cds) = cds$Name_Description
row.names(cds)
```

##Change the name of the row from a number to the name of the gene

```{r}
head(cds,6)
```

##Display the values of the first six data

```{r}
head(rowMeans(cds[2:4])) 
cds$mean = rowMeans(cds[2:4])
head(cds,6)
```

##Add a column to show the average of the gene values and display the first six sets of data

```{r}
order(-cds$mean)
sorted <- cds[order(-cds$mean),]
sorted[,c(4,ncol(sorted))]
head(sorted[,c(4,ncol(sorted))],10)
```

##List the 10 genes with the highest mean expression

```{r}
subset(cds,mean < 10)
nrow(subset(cds,mean < 10))
nrow(cds)
```


##List the number of rows with gene means less than 10 and calculate how many rows there are and what the total number of rows is


```{r}
hist(cds$mean,xlab="mean", main="Histogram of means")
```

##Histogram of averages

###The following is an analysis of the data 'growth_data.csv'

```{r}
read.csv("growth_data.csv")

cdss = read.csv("growth_data.csv")
head(cdss)
colnames(cdss)
```

##Read the document,and displays the column name


```{r}
cdss[cdss$Site=="northeast",]
site1 = cdss[cdss$Site=="northeast",]
cdss[cdss$Site=="southwest",]
site2 = cdss[cdss$Site=="southwest",]
mean(site1[,3])
sd(site1[,3])
mean(site1[,6])
sd(site1[,6])
mean(site2[,3])
sd(site2[,3])
mean(site2[,6])
sd(site2[,6])
```

##site1 is all the data in the northeast location tree, site2 is the data in the southwest location tree, determine the data and calculate the standard deviation and mean respectively

```{r}
boxplot(site1$Circumf_2005_cm, site1$Circumf_2020_cm,
        ylab="circumference",
        main="The northeast position starts and ends with the data",
        names = c("start","end"))

boxplot(site2$Circumf_2005_cm, site2$Circumf_2020_cm,
        ylab="circumference",
        main="The southwest position starts and ends with the data",
        names = c("start","end"))
```

##The data has already been sorted in the previous step, so you just need to do the box plot in this step.

```{r}
site1gr = mean(site1[,6])-mean(site1[,4])
site1gr/mean(site1[,4])


site2gr = mean(site2[,6])-mean(site2[,4])
site2gr/mean(site2[,4])
```


##Calculation of the growth rate
##step1: The present value is subtracted from the past value
##step2: the result is divided by the past value



```{r}
t.test(cdss$Circumf_2020_cm - cdss$Circumf_2010_cm~cdss$Site)
boxplot(cdss$Circumf_2020_cm - cdss$Circumf_2010_cm~cdss$Site,xlab = "location",ylab = "growth")
PVAL = t.test(cdss$Circumf_2020_cm - cdss$Circumf_2010_cm~cdss$Site)$p.value
HEADER=paste("P:",PVAL)
mtext(HEADER)

wilcox.test(cdss$Circumf_2020_cm - cdss$Circumf_2010_cm~cdss$Site)
boxplot(cdss$Circumf_2020_cm - cdss$Circumf_2010_cm~cdss$Site,xlab = "location",ylab = "growth")
PVAL = wilcox.test(cdss$Circumf_2020_cm - cdss$Circumf_2010_cm~cdss$Site)$p.value
HEADER=paste("P:",PVAL)
mtext(HEADER)
```



##The p-values are calculated using ttest and wilcox.test respectively, and it can be seen that the p-values calculated using ttest are smaller, and the differences in the data over 10 years are directly applied in the calculation, and no mean values are involved
